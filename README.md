Bin‑Aware Counterfactual Simulation for Process Mining
Reproducible code and materials for the BPMJ submission
This repository contains the full implementation, preprocessing scripts, modelling pipeline, and replication materials used in the study:
“Bin‑Aware Counterfactual Simulation for Process Mining:
A Methodological Framework Applied to Sepsis Care Pathways.”
The codebase provides a reusable implementation of bin‑aware counterfactual simulation operators, together with the complete workflow for reproducing all figures, tables, and results reported in the manuscript.
